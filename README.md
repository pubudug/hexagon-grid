# hexagon-grid
Hexagon grid library written using Java 8

A work in progress inspired by these [tutorials](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and [hexameter](https://github.com/Hexworks/hexameter).

- This library is planned to use Java8

- This library supports only [flat topped hexagons](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#basics)

- This library supports only rectangular grids

- offset coordinates are [odd-q](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates)

If you find any features missing, you should probably look at [hexameter](https://github.com/Hexworks/hexameter)
