# hexagon-grid
Hexagon grid library written using Java 8

Inspired by these [tutorials](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and [hexameter](https://github.com/Hexworks/hexameter).

- This library is planned to use Java8, whereas hexameter uses Java7.

- This library supports only [flat topped hexagons](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#basics) where as hexameter supports pointy topped hexagons as well.

- offset coordinates are [odd-q](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates)
